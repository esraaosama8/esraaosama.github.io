I'm a fresh graduate from Cairo University Faculty of Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. Looking for internships or full-time jobs in Web Development or UI/UX Design to work on what I've learnt so far through the courses I've been taking online. I dedicate my time and become committed to any tasks given to me.
Also hopefully I would be able to learn new technologies and features if needed for any job.

    }

ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(Bio), document.querySelector('#bio'));
