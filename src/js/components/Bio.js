I'm a fresh graduate from Cairo University Faculty of Computer Science and AI. I'm looking for internships or part-time jobs in different fields if applicable.
Want to work on what I've learned so far through the courses I've been taking. Hopefully, I would be able to learn new technologies and features if needed for any job. 
I dedicate my time and commit to any tasks given to me.

                </p>

    }

ReactDOM.render(React.createElement(Bio), document.querySelector('#bio'));
